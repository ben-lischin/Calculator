# Calculator
This is a calculator app I made to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You may innteract with it by either clicking the buttons on the calculator, or typting through a keyboard.
Here are the accepted keyboard inputs, as well as what button they map to:
  • c         -> clear
  • backspace -> del
  • return    -> =
  • 0-9       -> the corresponding number
  • +         -> +
  • -         -> -
  • x,*    -> ×
  • /         -> ÷
  • ^         -> ^
  • .         -> .
  • (         -> (
  • )         -> )
