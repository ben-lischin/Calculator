# Calculator
This is a calculator app I made to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\
You may interact with it by either clicking the buttons on the calculator, or typting through a keyboard.\

Here are the accepted keyboard inputs, as well as what button they map to:\

| Key           | Button        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| c             | clear         |
| col 2 is      | centered      |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |

  • c         -> clear\
  • backspace -> del\
  • return    -> =\
  • 0-9       -> the corresponding number\
  • +         -> +\
  • -         -> -\
  • x,*    -> ×\
  • /         -> ÷\
  • ^         -> ^\
  • .         -> .\
